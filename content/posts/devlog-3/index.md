Devlog #3: A server room adventure

When CANCOM agreed to sponsor us with actual networking hardware for our
project, it suddenly felt a lot more real. Until then, everything existed in
virtual environments and documents - now we had physical routers and switches
waiting to be unboxed, mounted, and configured.

Getting them to school was an adventure in itself. I ended up loading the boxes
into my parents’ car (shoutout to the surprisingly good trunk space) and
carefully navigating through traffic with what felt like half a data center in
the backseat.

Once we arrived, reality hit us: we had the hardware, the motivation, and the
people - but no idea where to put it. I was told a certain room Number, which
didn't exist. After carrying hardware through the whole school, we decided to
sore it in our classroom, before deploying it in the server room a few days
later.

Danijel took charge of the mounting process - screwing, measuring, and
occasionally questioning the sanity of whoever designed rack rails. The rest of
us joined in, helping with cables and the general chaos that comes with setting
up real hardware for the first time.

Of course, no setup would be complete without at least one critical item
missing. In our case: a console cable. We had everything ready, neatly installed
and wired up, but couldn’t actually connect to the devices. After a mild moment
of despair and a few searches through drawers, we managed to lend a fitting
cable from a kind professor.

Karun and I took over from there, setting up and testing each device to make
sure everything worked as planned. Slowly, LEDs started blinking, pings began
replying, and our network was finally ready for getting fully configured.

In hindsight, it wasn’t the smoothest process - but that’s what made it
memorable. Between missing cables, tight spaces, and spontaneous
problem-solving, we got a real taste of what deploying hardware is like outside
of GNS3.
