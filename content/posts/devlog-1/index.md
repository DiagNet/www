How DiagNet was born (our diploma thesis story)

Ever spent weeks trying to come up with the one idea for a final project? Yeah,
us too. Spoiler: it’s harder than it sounds.

We sat around, filled whiteboards with more scribbles than actual words, and
still... nothing really clicked. Some ideas sounded cool for a few minutes,
others would have been fun but didn’t quite match our requirements.

Our wish list was simple:

- Main focus on programming
- Something with computer networking
- Exciting to work on

After some collective despair, salvation arrived in the form of CANCOM, an IT
and networking solutions company. They presented a handful of project ideas to
our class. One of them immediately stood out: a test-driven networking solution
using pyATS.

That was it. The perfect mix of code and networks. We saw the potential right
away - it matched our skills and our interests. After some extra consideration,
we decided to commit to this idea.

The name? That was my contribution. And just like that, DiagNet was born.
