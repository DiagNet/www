How DiagNet was born (aka our diploma thesis story)

Ever spent weeks trying to come up with the one idea for a final project? Yeah,
us too. Spoiler: it‚Äôs harder than it sounds.

We sat around, filled whiteboards with more scribbles than actual words, and
still‚Ä¶ nothing really clicked. Some ideas sounded cool for about five minutes,
others would have been fun but didn‚Äôt quite match our requirements.

Our wish list was simple (or so we thought):

- Main focus on programming
- Something with computer networking
- Not completely boring

After some collective despair‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, salvation arrived in the form of CANCOM, an IT
and networking solutions company. They presented a handful of project ideas to
our class. One of them immediately stood out: a test-driven networking solution
using pyATS.

That was it. The perfect mix of code and networks. We saw the potential right
away‚Äîit matched our skills and our interests. After some extra consideration
(read: more whiteboard doodles), we decided to commit.

The name? That was my contribution. And just like that, DiagNet was born. üéâ
