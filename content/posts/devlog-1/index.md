This is how we found the idea for our diploma thesis DiagNet:

We brainstormed for several weeks to find a suitable idea for our final project.
Many concepts came to mind, but none really fit our requirements.
We wanted a software project that placed the main focus on programming, while
also incorporating aspects of computer networking.

After some despair, CANCOM, an IT and networking solutions company, presented a
few project ideas to our class.
One of them was a test-driven networking solution using pyATS.
We immediately saw potential in this idea, as it matched both our interests and
our skills.

After some additional consideration, our team decided to commit to this concept
for our diploma thesis. I came up with the name, and thus DiagNet was born.
