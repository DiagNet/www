Devlog #2: Summer holidays, code, and… more holidays

When we first decided to start our diploma thesis project during the summer
holidays, we thought it would be the perfect opportunity: plenty of time, no
school stress, just us and the code.

In practice, things turned out a bit differently.

We worked mostly from home, coordinating through regular Discord meetings. From
the beginning, we split the tasks so everyone had a clear direction:

- Karun bravely set up the GitHub repo (because someone had to face CI/CD).
- Danijel and Luka jumped headfirst into Django, figuring out how to profit from
  Python's dynamic character.
- I decided to explore Ansible, because who doesn’t love automating things you
  barely understand yet?

It gave us a starting point and ensured that each of us could explore the areas
most relevant to the project.

Of course, it was summer break. As motivated as we were, everyone ended up
taking time off—sometimes for a week, sometimes for more than a month. Our
initial vision of long, uninterrupted work sessions quickly shifted into shorter
sprints between vacations.

Even so, progress happened. Each time we returned and caught up on Discord, we
brought new pieces to the table. Slowly, the project began to take shape. We
didn’t have everything planned out in advance; instead, we figured things out
step by step as we went along.

Looking back, those first weeks were less about speed and more about laying the
foundation. It was when we set up our tools, defined our roles, and started to
understand how DiagNet could actually work.
