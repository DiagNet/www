[DiagNet](https://github.com/DiagNet) (DGNT) is developed by [HTL
Rennweg](https://htlrennweg.at) students. The goal is simple: make network
testing easier, centralized, and more transparent.

Instead of running every test manually, DiagNet provides a web application with
a clear interface and a flexible backend. Tests can be started quickly, planned
ahead, stored, and repeated whenever needed.

The system is aimed at network administrators and IT professionals — both in
training and in production environments. Results are collected, compared, and
make changes in the network visible over time.

In short: DiagNet turns network testing from a manual chore into a centralized,
automated, and analyzable process.
